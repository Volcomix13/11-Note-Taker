# 11-Note-Taker

## Description
This project was created to provide users with an online notepad. This notepad can be used to make lists, short notations, or to jot down reminders. This was also built to help develop skills in Express js.
The challenges I encountered were mainly learning how to deploy the application and how to make the routes work with the main server.js file.
